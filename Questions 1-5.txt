1. a) A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
   b) INNER JOIN is combing two tables using one same column in both tables. F.e: Products and Categories tables will be joining with the Category_id column
   c) The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all data from the left table, and the matching data from the right table
   Ex: A:1, 2, 3, 4   B:2, 3, 5, 6      A Left Joins B = 1,2,3,4 
   d) The RIGHT JOIN is the same with LEFT JOIN but vice versa 
2. The ALTER TABLE statement in SQL is used to modify the structure of an existing table. This can include adding, modifying, or deleting columns and changing other table properties
   Adding: ALTER TABLE Members
           ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);
   Modifying: a) ALTER TABLE Books
              ALTER COLUMN authors TYPE Charfield;
              b) ALTER TABLE Members
              RENAME COLUMN first_name TO full_name;
   Dropping: ALTER TABLE Members
             DROP COLUMN Phone;
3. A foreign key is a unique identifier of another table that support relationship between them.
